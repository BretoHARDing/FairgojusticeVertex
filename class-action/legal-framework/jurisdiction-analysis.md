# JURISDICTIONAL ANALYSIS
## Class Action Certification Options

### OPTION 1: FEDERAL COURT (Part IVA)
**Statute:** Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, Part IVA

**Requirements:**
- 7 or more persons
- Claims in respect of same, similar, or related circumstances
- Substantial common questions of law or fact
- Federal jurisdiction required

**Advantages:**
- Opt-out procedure (better for large classes)
- National scope is well-suited to the widespread nature of the conduct.
- Experienced in complex, multi-faceted litigation involving corporate misconduct.
- Can address federal law issues directly (e.g., insurance law, federal VIN regulations).

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires a clear "federal jurisdiction hook," which must be firmly established.
- Potentially higher complexity and cost threshold compared to state courts.

### OPTION 2: NSW SUPREME COURT
**Statute:** Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), Part 10

**Requirements:**
- 7 or more persons
- Same interest in proceedings
- Common questions of law/fact

**Advantages:**
- State-based fraud and negligence claims naturally fit.
- Familiar with NSW-specific issues and defendants (if primarily NSW-based).
- May be a simpler and faster path to certification.

**Disadvantages:**
- May be limited to an "opt-in" procedure, which can significantly reduce class size.
- Limited to NSW scope, which may not capture the full extent of the national scheme.
- May not be the ideal forum for federal law questions (insurance, VIN fraud).

### OPTION 3: OTHER STATE COURTS
- An analysis of Victorian or Queensland courts could be undertaken if a significant number of class members are identified in those states, but this would fragment the action.

### RECOMMENDATION
**Leaning towards the Federal Court.**

The preliminary assessment favors the Federal Court due to the national scale of the alleged conduct, the clear involvement of federal law (insurance and VIN fraud), and the desirability of an "opt-out" class to capture all potential victims.

This recommendation is conditional and requires a formal legal opinion based on a full review of the evidence to confirm the strength of the federal jurisdiction hook.
